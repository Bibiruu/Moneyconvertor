Created a moneyconvertor program for EUR to USD and viceversa.

Had a simple styling in the HTML for input and a button to convert to the choice of liking. 

Created two functions. 
  First for usdeur() and another eurusd(). Getting the amount input from HTML and the returning the value after a button click.
